# Python Execution Model

You cannot understand specific Python security vulnerabilities without better understanding how Python runs. This section should cover the bytecode compilation, the PVM (Python Virtual Machine), and how Python handles memory and dynamic typing.

To understand which security threats are relevant to Python code, knowledge of the internal workings of the Python interpreter is required.

Understanding how Python source files (`*.py`) are executed is crucial from a security point of view.

The default and most widely used interpreter is CPython, distributed by the Python Software Foundation (PSF). The core CPython source code cannot be easily compromised; multiple defensive measures are taken to prevent weaknesses in the code and to protect against supply chain attacks. While trust is essential, verification is better: the open-source nature of Python allows anyone to inspect the code or validate the PSF’s processes if required.

Most secure Unix distributions and all BSD systems require that CPython is built from source. Some distributions use reproducible builds to minimise the risk of supply chain attacks on the CPython code.

While Python is an interpreted language, it involves a compilation step where source code is converted into bytecode (`.pyc`). This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

Detailed Execution Steps:

1. **Source Code**: Python code is a file with a `.py` extension.

2. **Compilation to Bytecode**: When the program is run, the Python Compiler first translates the source code into an intermediate format called bytecode. During this phase, it also checks for syntax errors. This bytecode is a set of instructions tailored for the Python Virtual Machine. This bytecode is a platform-independent representation that is not specific to any operating system or hardware. The compiled bytecode is then stored in a .pyc file. For faster loading in future runs, the bytecode is saved as a `.pyc` file in a `__pycache__` directory. If a script is run directly, e.g. python `myscript.py`, Python compiles it to bytecode in memory only. After execution no bytecode is saved. So `.pyc` files are only created when a file is imported and when chasing is enabled (which is by default).

3. **Execution by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**: The bytecode is then passed to the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which acts as an interpreter. The PVM reads the bytecode instructions and translates them into machine-specific (binary) code that the computer's CPU can understand and execute.

+++

4. **Execution and Output**: The computer's CPU executes the machine code instructions, interacts with the hardware (memory, I/O devices, etc.), and produces the final results or output of the program.


This flow ensures that Python is platform-independent at the bytecode level, as any system with a compatible PVM can run the same bytecode.


CPython is the reference implementation written in C. CPython functions as both a compiler and an interpreter. It first compiles Python source code into an intermediate format called bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), a runtime environment written in C.

Python Code goes through parsing, complication and execution. Bytecode is the intermediate representation.

CPython is a stack based virtual machine. This means that it executes instructions using a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) stack data structure** to store and retrieve data, rather than using general-purpose registers. 

Inside the CPython VM, each function call has an associated "frame," which contains a specific "evaluation stack" (or "value stack"). This is where most of the work happens.

The Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which is part of the **CPython interpreter**, is written in the **C programming language** and uses the standard **C API** and **C runtime library** to make calls to the operating system.  So instead of talking to the OS directly from Python code (which would not be platform-independent), the PVM includes an implementation layer (written in C) that uses the underlying OS's own Application Programming Interface (API) to perform tasks using the Operating System.

So Python's execution model combines interpretation with compilation. The Bytecode is an intermediate representation between the high-level Python source code and machine code. 
Bytecode is the intermediate representation that the PVM executes. The bytecode is more efficient to run compared to interpreting the source code directly.

Below is an example how you can see how Python code is compiled to bytecode:
