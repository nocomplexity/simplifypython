# Python Security Fundamentals

This chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the security mechanics inherent in Python development. We begin by deconstructing the Python Execution Model, establishing how the underlying runtime influences the safety of your code. Building on this technical foundation, we define a formal Python Threat Model to identify trust boundaries and protect vital assets.

The focus then shifts outward to the Python Attack Landscape, examining the external risks posed by the modern software supply chain and third-party dependencies. By understanding this environment, we categorise specific Python Security Threats.
