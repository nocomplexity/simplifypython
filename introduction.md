# Introduction

Having Python programming skills is **essential** for architects, engineers, and managers in the IT industry, especially when working with data or ML/AI applications.

Finding professionals with deep programming knowledge and solid experience is already challenging and will only get harder as AI, like LLM prompts, makes it easier for anyone to create software. While LLMs can generate answers, code, and snippets, a basic understanding of Python programming remains crucial in today's world.

The answers programs snippets you receive from LLM prompts are often not good enough. You still need explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge to judge and use the AI answer in the right way. Explicit knowledge can be learned by training, courses and reading books. Tacit knowledge can only be gained by doing and making mistakes.

Programming is fundamentally about problem-solving. To solve problems effectively, you should use a variety of tools. Rarely can a problem be solved with software alone. So use real [Problem Solving Methods](https://www.bm-support.org/problem-solving-methods/) before creating a software program that only solves part of the problem.


There are also numerous great Python [open access](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open/open-access.html) [books and courses](books) available at no cost. 


:::{admonition} Solving problems **should** be simple!
:class: tip, dropdown
Solving a problem with the use of a computer should be as simple as possible. I have used many programming languages. A language is a tool. No tool is perfect. But Python comes close the simplicity scorecard! 

Almost every typical programming problem you can think of, is already solved with Python in many different ways. The challenge is often to search for a good solution that fits your use-case. But beware: Creating [Simple IT Solutions](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/reports/SimplifyIT.pdf) is hard!

I created this publication for myself. Despite the great [open access books](books) available, I missed a simple resources on Python that covers aspects behind the basics. Python is one of the tools in my toolbox for problem solving. Sharing is fun so maybe this publication is also of value for you. I advocate to avoid complexity when using Python to create solutions. But creating things simple takes a lot of effort.
