# Companies

Besides many Foundations that are funded to keep the Python eco-system healthy, or provide solid open tools we all benefit from, there are commercial companies that deliver products that are heavily used by many Python programmers.

When using a FOSS product that is backed by a commercial company it is always good to check if the tools provided are really open. Most ethical Python companies that deliver good products make a profit by selling ad-ons for large companies or institutions, provide hosting or sell support or courses.

Using FOSS products from commercial companies should not involve additional risks. But the simple checklist to be sure is:
* Are the products really FOSS licenced?
* How does the company make profit? If this is vague or not transparent, chance is that the FOSS product offered is not fully usuable without buying the commercial add-on(s).
* How is the governance of the FOSS product organized?
* Is there an open version and both a paid version of the same product? Usually this is a red flag!
