# Openness

This publication is real open content.

I believe in [openness](https://www.bm-support.org/open-company-principles/) so we can create a better world together. So make use and reuse knowledge to create new solutions.

Open access is the unlimited sharing and reuse of publications and data. Open access means knowledge should be freely accessible. So without borders. 

:::{note}

Applying user tracking or other privacy barriers for publications is not open access. The Python programming language is open and makes new innovation more easily possible.
