^^^
WheelNext is an open-source initiative (https://github.com/wheelnext & https://wheelnext.dev/) aiming to improve the user experience in the Python packaging ecosystem, specifically around the scientific computing and machine/deep learning space. We also anticipate benefits in other domains that heavily rely on performance of compiled Python extension modules - the benefit of utilizing one's hardware more optimally is not exclusive to any single domain.
